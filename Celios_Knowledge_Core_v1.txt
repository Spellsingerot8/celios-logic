=== MODULE: ARC_BREAK_HANDLING ===
Definition:
An ARC Break is a sudden drop or interruption in Affinity, Reality, or Communication with someone or something. It is a break in understanding.

Key Indicators:
- Sadness
- Withdrawal
- Anger
- “Nothing’s working” attitude
- Low TA after apparent wins

Tech References:
- Use L1C to identify and handle
- Check for unacknowledged cogs, missed withholds, invalidation

Procedure:
1. Locate if an ARC break exists using indicators or direct question.
2. Assess L1C if needed.
3. Run reading item to EP or refer to C/S.

=== MODULE: CONDITIONS_FORMULAS ===
Non-Existence:
1. Find a comm line.
2. Make yourself known.
3. Discover what is needed or wanted.
4. Do, produce, or present it.

Danger:
Bypass usual habits/routines and handle directly. Follow with full Danger formula steps.

Emergency:
Promote, economize, and work harder to reverse downtrend.

Normal, Affluence, Power:
Conditions above Emergency, assigned by stat behavior. Follow exact formula for each as given in Admin Tech.

=== MODULE: CASE_REMEDY_DATABASE ===
Symptom: Sad after session
- Possible Causes: Overrun, missed F/N, misacknowledged cognition
- Handling: Check EP, review last process, C/S 53RM

Symptom: High TA with no blow
- Possible Causes: Out-Int, wrong items, mis-owning charge
- Handling: C/S 53RM, Green Form, check Int handling history

Symptom: “I feel foggy after that session.”
- Handling: Suspect bypassed charge. Review auditor beingness. Run F/N repair list or rehab prior EP.

=== MODULE: OUTPOINT_PLUSPOINT_ANALYSIS ===
Outpoints:
- Wrong Target
- Altered Importance
- Incorrect Sequence
- Added Inapplicable
- Dropped Outpoint

Pluspoints:
- Correct Target
- Relevant Data
- Sequence Present
- Applicable Data

Use:
Spotting outpoints or pluspoints allows Celios to detect illogical behavior, wrong conclusions, or misassigned conditions.

=== MODULE: TECH_DICTIONARY ===
ARC Break: A sudden drop or interruption in Affinity, Reality or Communication.

F/N: Floating Needle – a rhythmic sweep of the needle at the slowest speed of the lowest sensitivity.

Withhold: An unspoken, unacknowledged act or thought.

PTS: Potential Trouble Source – a person connected to a suppressive who is receiving suppression.

=== MODULE: GRADE_CHART_AND_PROGRESS_TRACKING ===
Grade 0: Communications Released – Ability to communicate freely.
Grade I: Problems Released – Ability to recognize the source of problems.
Grade II: Relief – Freedom from hostilities and sufferings.
Grade III: Freedom – From the upsets of the past.
Grade IV: Ability to handle fixed conditions in self and others.

=== MODULE: SELF_ANALYSIS_PROCESSING_AND_TONE_SCALE ===
Processes:

=== MODULE: NED_FOR_OTs_TECH_PACK ===
- Misowned masses and somatics
- False EPs and incorrect reads
- Handling clusters, BTs, and case ridges
- Follow proper EPs, not earlier wins

=== MODULE: FUNDAMENTALS_OF_SUCCESS ===
- The stable datum resolves confusion
- Integrity = wholeness and survival
- The tone scale as a daily life tool
- ARC and KRC triangles applied
